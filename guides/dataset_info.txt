Open Radar Dataset Structure
------------------------------------

The dataset is a Python dictionary and primarily contains Doppler spectra, but there is also other useful information.
Each ".npy" file contains a dictionary of signatures, where each signature corresponds to a full radar track and contains:

Field name          | Explanation
--------------------|------------------------------------------
signature           | Numpy array of the Doppler spectra for that track
ts                  | Timestamp for each spectrum
range               | Measured range for the detection
azimuth             | Measured azimuth for the detection
velocity            | Measured radial velocity
snr_db              | Estimated SNR in dB (from 1D CFAR)
x                   | Kalman-filtered X-position
y                   | Kalman-filtered Y-position
z                   | Kalman-filtered Z-position
class_name          | Class name string (e.g., 'uav', 'vehicle', 'human')
radar_parameters    | Dictionary with radar parameters

The 'radar_parameters' dictionary contains sensor and waveform-specific parameters:

Field name              | Explanation
-------------------------|---------------------------------
num_range_bins           | Number of range bins
num_pulses               | Number of pulses in each frame
num_antenna_elements     | Number of receiver elements sampled
fc                       | Center frequency (Hz)
bw                       | Sampled bandwidth (Hz)
prf                      | Pulse repetition frequency (PRF)
